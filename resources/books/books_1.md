			<td width="50%">
				If you’re one of many developers still uncertain about concurrent and
				multithreaded development, this practical cookbook will change your mind.
				With more than 85 code-rich recipes in this updated second edition, author
				Stephen Cleary demonstrates parallel processing and asynchronous programming
				techniques using libraries and language features in .NET and C# 8.0.
				<br /><br />
				Concurrency is now more common in responsive and scalable application
				development, but it’s still extremely difficult to code. The detailed
				solutions in this cookbook show you how modern tools raise the level of
				abstraction, making concurrency much easier than before. Complete with
				ready-to-use code and discussions about how and why solutions work.

				Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving
				<br />
				2nd Edition
				<br /><br />
				2019, 9781492054504
			</td>
			<td width="50%">
				The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's syntax—it's learning to creatively solve problems 
				so you can build something great. In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways 
				that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think 
				Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion,
				and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to:
				<ul>
				  <li>Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve</li>
				  <li>Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries</li>
				  <li>Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job</li>
				  <li>Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory</li>
				  <li>Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
                Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language;
				in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative 
				art—and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer.
